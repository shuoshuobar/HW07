## Beer and Dog Analysis Assignments
### This repository contains two assignments focused on analyzing beer and dog data using Python. The beer assignment explores a dataset of craft beers, answering questions about breweries, beer styles and high-IBU beers while showcasing data cleaning and visualization techniques. The dog assignment analyzes NYC dog data merged with borough population data to calculate metrics like dogs per capita and identify the top breeds in each borough. Key tasks include data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing formats), merging datasets and creating visualizations for the two datasets.
